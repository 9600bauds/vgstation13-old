# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# There needs to be a space after the - and before the prefix. Don't use tabs anywhere in this file.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# If you're using characters such as # ' : - or the like in your changelog, surround the entire change with quotes as shown in the second example. These quotes don't show up on the changelog once it's merged and prevent errors.
# SCREW ANY OF THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

- bugfix: "Players can now once again change their clothes, use their backpack etc while inside a locker. Can't wait to see all the exploits that will come out of this!"
- bugfix: "Cyborgs and MoMMIs can no longer attack people from inside lockers, recharging stations etc."
- bugfix: "Also fixed Cyborgs and MoMMIs being able to weld/unweld a locker from inside, unwrench a recharging station from inside, etc. If you notice any actions that a silicon should be to do suddenly not working anymore, please don't hesitate to make a bug report."
