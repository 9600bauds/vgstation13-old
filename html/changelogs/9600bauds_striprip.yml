# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# There needs to be a space after the - and before the prefix. Don't use tabs anywhere in this file.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# If you're using characters such as # ' : - or the like in your changelog, surround the entire change with quotes as shown in the second example. These quotes don't show up on the changelog once it's merged and prevent errors.
# SCREW ANY OF THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
changes: 
- experiment: "The following changes required a lot of rewriting and refactoring of old-ass code. I've tested this as best as I could, but if you notice any bugs still, please don't hesitate to make a bug report!"
- rscadd: "Trying to put an item in the wrong slot via the stripping menu now gives an explicit error message, so as to not waste your time."
- tweak: "Buffed the Pickpocket's Gloves: Their effects now apply to all storage slots, not just ID and pockets."
- rscadd: "You can now toggle someone's suit sensors via the stripping menu, without having to remove their jumpsuit."
- tweak: "There is now one unified option to toggle other people's internals via the stripping menu, which is available even if they have a tank in their pockets or hands."
- tweak: "Simplified the way toggling internals chooses a tank: It will now simply look in your suit storage, then back, then belt, then pockets, then hands. It will also only take internals from a jetpack as last option."
- bugfix: "Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_found() effects (e.g. mousetraps) when stripped individually, only when your jumpsuit was stripped."
- bugfix: "Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_stripped() effects (e.g. SPS) when your jumpsuit was stripped, only individually."
- rscdel: "Removes the ability to perform CPR on alien larvas. Sorry guys."
- bugfix: "Accidentally fixed bug where you could spam CPR and do CPR multiple times at the same time in the same mob. Sorry guys."
